# Assignment: Exploring JavaScript Spread Syntax
AD 320 Assignment

## Objective
This assignment is designed to help you understand and practice the concepts of spread syntax in JavaScript. You'll work on a series of tasks that will test your ability to use spread syntax in various contexts, including functions, arrays, and objects.

### Task 1: Function Argument Expansion
Define a function named sum that takes three arguments and returns their sum.
Create an array named numbers with three numeric elements of your choice.
Call the sum function using the spread syntax to pass the elements of numbers as arguments.
Print the result to the console.
### Task 2: Merging Arrays
Create two arrays, array1 with the elements [1, 2, 3] and array2 with the elements [4, 5, 6].
Merge array1 and array2 into a new array called mergedArray using spread syntax.
Print mergedArray to the console and ensure that it contains all the elements from both arrays.
### Task 3: Array Element Insertion
Create an array named colors with the elements 'red', 'green', and 'blue'.
Use spread syntax to create a new array extendedColors that includes 'yellow' at the beginning, the elements of colors, and 'purple' at the end.
Print extendedColors to the console.
### Task 4: Cloning and Modifying an Object
Define an object person with properties name: 'John' and age: 30.
Use spread syntax to create a clone of the person object named newPerson.
Modify newPerson by changing the name property to 'Jane' and adding a new property gender with the value 'female'.
Print both person and newPerson to ensure that they are separate objects and that person is not affected by the modifications to newPerson.
### Task 5: Combining Objects
Create two objects, object1 with properties { a: 1, b: 2 } and object2 with properties { b: 3, c: 4 }.
Combine object1 and object2 into a new object combinedObject using spread syntax, ensuring that properties from object2 overwrite those in object1 when there are conflicts.
Print combinedObject to verify that it has the correct properties and values.
